Matlab code: steepDescent.m implements the steepest descent algorithm to find the steepest descent of a below function:

f = 1/2*x1^2 + a/2*x2^2, where a is 'a' positive real number

Matlab code: objectEquation.m solves the inverse scattering problem for given contrast function of some object.
Born Approximation is not assumed and a linear system of equation, 

(I - G*C)x = Uinc
G and C matrices are obtained from discretized form of object equation.

The detailed equations are mentioned in the Assignment pdf.
